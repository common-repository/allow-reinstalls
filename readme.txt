== Description ==
Allows plugins and themes to be updated using the standard WordPress plugin or theme update process.

When you want to update a custom plugin or theme but don't have an automated process
then you can use this plugin to allow you to install a new version of a plugin or theme
without having to delete the existing plugin or theme.

Tested with WordPress 6.4 and WordPress MultiSite.
Note: This plugin is no longer necessary. WordPress core functionality allows you to update existing plugins and themes.


== Installation ==
1. Upload the contents of the allow-reinstalls plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/allow-reinstalls` directory
1. Do nothing until you want to update another plugin or theme.


If you've attempted to upload a plugin and you've received the message that says

`
Destination folder already exists. path-to/wp-content/plugins/your-plugin/

Plugin install failed.
`

or you've attempted to upload a theme and got

`
Destination folder already exists. path-to/wp-content/themes/your-theme/

Theme install failed.
`

then you need to


1. Activate the allow-reinstalls plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Upload the plugin or theme you want to replace.
1. Deactivate the allow-reinstalls plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this work on WordPress MultiSite? =
Yes. Use it as a super administrator.

= Can I downgrade a plugin or theme? =
You'll be able to do it, but whether or not the system works afterwards depends on the plugin or theme.

= Can I leave the plugin active? =
No point. 

= Why doesn't WordPress allow this anyway? =
It does now.

Safety and security; just in case you overwrite the latest version with a back level.

WordPress expects to receive most of its updates automatically, not via a manual upload process.

== Screenshots ==

2. Try again after activating the allow-reinstalls plugin
3. Upload succeeds this time.
